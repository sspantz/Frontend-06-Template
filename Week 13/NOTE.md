## Definition of HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)
- [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
  - Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a `markup` language that defines a set of rules for `encoding documents` in a format that is both `human-readable` and `machine-readable`. The [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium)'s XML 1.0 Specification of `1998` and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML.
  - The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a `textual` data format with strong support via `Unicode` for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.
- [SGML](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SGML/) [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language)
  - SGML, Standard Generalized Markup Language, is an enabling technology used in applications such as HTML. (see: Toward a Formalism for Communication on the Web).
  - ISO 8879: 1986, born in 1960s by IBM
  - Declarative: Markup should describe a document's `structure` and other attributes rather than specify the processing that needs to be performed, because it is less likely to conflict with future developments.
  - Rigorous: In order to allow markup to take advantage of the techniques available for processing rigorously defined `objects` like programs and databases.

The HTML specifications assume a working knowledge of SGML. The SGML standard itself is not available online, but there's plenty of code to read if you're a hacker, and a few introductory documents for everybody.
